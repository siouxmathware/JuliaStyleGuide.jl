# A Style Guide for writing good Julia
This repository hosts a Julia style guide.
It is written in the form of a repository to allow:
- easy inclusion of the documenation in JuliaHub
- using Markdown to format inline Julia example
- relatively easy editting and quality assurance via git

The published documentation is visible on JuliaHub (link to be provided once package is registered).

# Making the documentation
To create the documentation, simply execute the `make.jl` script in the docs folder, _within the `docs` environment._
