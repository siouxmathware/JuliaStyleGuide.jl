# A Style Guide for writing good Julia
There are many style guides out there. To name a few: [YASGuide](https://github.com/jrevels/YASGuide), [JuliaLang style guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/) and the [Blue Style Guide](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle).
What is covered by these style guides is, however, limited largely to simple questions on details.
We choose to stick the [Blue Style Guide](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle) in principle. 
Compliance to this style guide is easily achieved by using a Julia Formatter along with a JuliaFormatter.toml file, as used in this repo.
This document intends to provide guidelines to elements _not_ covered by the Blue style guide.

# First principles
The guidelines in this document follow from first principles. 
1. Software is "soft", it should be easy to change code to suit new requirements.
2. Guidelines provide answers to simple questions to allow focus during code review to be on the important answers. (They prevent [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).)
3. Guidelines are complementary to an autoformatter.

# Guidelines
The guidelines are discussed in separate chapters to be accessed via the menu on the left.
